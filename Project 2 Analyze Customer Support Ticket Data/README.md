# üßÆ Project 2: Analyze Customer Support Ticket Data

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring customer support ticket data to understand common issues and how they are handled. You'll work with real-world support data to surface patterns and trends that inform customer service operations.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Write SQL queries to explore customer service-related datasets
- Clean and standardize text-based fields
- Aggregate data to find trends in issue types, resolution times, and volumes
- Practice filtering and summarizing operational data
